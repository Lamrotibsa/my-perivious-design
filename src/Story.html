            <p>Harari is a Semitic language of eastern Ethiopia spoken primarily in the region of Harar. There are
                approximately
                25,000 native speakers (2007 census), the vast majority of whom are also fluent in Amharic, the national
                language, and Oromo, another language of the region.

                How endangered is Harari? The survival of Harari in the coming generations is difficult to predict. The
                fact
                that it is still regularly spoken in many communities, including by children, is a positive sign of its
                health.
                However, the fact that the overall numbers are low, that the majority of speakers are also fluent in
                another
                more dominant regional language and that the language is not officially supported through educational
                system are
                cautionary signs that its use will decline.</p>

            <p>The famous ‘Hyena Men’ of Harar are a unique phenomenon in not just Ethiopia but all of Africa.Seen as fearful wild animals by almost everyone else, each night a young man sits at the bottom of the hill on the edge of town surrounded by a pack of hungry hyenas. If you didn’t know better you’d think that this terrifying situation would be short lived as one of the hyenas devours the human giving it food. Instead, each hyena approaches slowly and gently, taking morsels of meat from the hand of man in much the same way as a pet dog would do. His name is Abbas and he is the youngest generation of Hyena feeders in Harar. In the 1950s his father Yusuf was one of the first to start this tradition after he began feeding the hyenas scraps of meat to lure them away from eating his livestock.
