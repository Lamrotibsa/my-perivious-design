    <p>Harar is different to any other Ethiopian city, a walled town, with over 360 twisting and winding alleys squeezed
        into 1 square kilometre, it is similar to the medinas of Morocco. Harar is the Islam capital of Ethiopia and is
        crammed with mosques, colourful markets, coffee shops and crumbling walls. It is colourful and photogenic and
        the Adare (Hariri) women’s dresses and head scarves are particularly colourful and exotic.”</p>
    <p>
        “The most spectacular part of the cultural Heritage is certainly the traditional Harari house, whose
        architectural form is typical, specific and original, different from the domestic layout usually known in Muslim
        countries, although reminiscent of the coastal Arab architecture. Their style is unique in Ethiopia and their
        interior design quite exceptional. When Harari people mention the “Harari culture” they actually refer to the
        beauty of their houses, which they are very proud of. At the end of the 19th century Indian merchants built new
        houses whose wooden verandas defined a different urban landscape and influenced the construction of
        Indian/Harari houses. Their architectural and ornamental qualities are now part of the Harari cultural heritage.
        The city is very well preserved, and few modern buildings have damaged the traditional architectural
        typologies.”

    <p>“Spotted hyenas could be considered the most hated mammal in Africa. Decried as ugly and awkward, associated with
        witches and sorcerers and seen as contaminating, spotted hyenas are a public relations challenge of the highest
        order. Yet in Harar, hyenas are not only allowed into the town to clean the streets of food scraps, they are
        deeply embedded in the traditions and beliefs of the townspeople.”</p>
    <p>The walls of Harar were pierced in early times by five gates, a number supposed to symbolize the Five Pillars of
        Islam. Each of these city gates play a different role in the economy of the city and of neighbouring lands.</p>
